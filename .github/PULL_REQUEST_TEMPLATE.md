Thank you for taking the time to work on a Pull Request. Your contribution is really appreciated! :tada:
**Please don't delete any part of the template**, since keeping the provided structure will help maintainers to review your work more rapidly.

## Breaking change

If your PR contains a breaking change for existing users, it is important to describe what breaks, how to make it work again and why we did this. This section will be used to craft the changelog entry, after your PR gets approved and merged.

Note: Remove this section if this PR is NOT a breaking change.

## Proposed change\*

Describe the big picture of your changes here, and why your pull request should be accepted. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to put `closes #XXXX` in this section to auto-close relevant issues.

Please note that for important and breaking changes it's always better to open an issue first for discussing the proposal.

Make sure to provide enough information so that your pull request can be reviewed.
