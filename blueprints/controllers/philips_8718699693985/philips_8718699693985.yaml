    # Controller - Philips 8718699693985 Hue Smart Button

    Controller automation for executing any kind of action triggered by the provided Philips 8718699693985 Hue Smart Button. Allows to optionally loop an action on a button long press.
    Supports deCONZ, ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT.

    Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
    Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more.
    See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/docs/blueprints/controllers/philips_8718699693985#available-hooks) for additional details.

    📕 Full documentation regarding this blueprint is available [here](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/docs/blueprints/controllers/philips_8718699693985).
