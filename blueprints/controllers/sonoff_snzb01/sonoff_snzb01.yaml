    # Controller - SONOFF SNZB-01 Wireless Switch

    Controller automation for executing any kind of action triggered by the provided SONOFF SNZB-01 Wireless Switch.
    Supports deCONZ, ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT.

    Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
    Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more.
    See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/docs/blueprints/controllers/sonoff_snzb01#available-hooks) for additional details.

    📕 Full documentation regarding this blueprint is available [here](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/docs/blueprints/controllers/sonoff_snzb01).

    🚀 This blueprint is part of the **[Awesome HA Blueprints](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints) project**.

        Delay used for debouncing RAW controller events, by default set to 0. A value of 0 disables the debouncing feature. Increase this value if you notice custom actions or linked Hooks running multiple times when interacting with the device. When the controller needs to be debounced,
        usually a value of 100 is enough to remove all duplicate events.
