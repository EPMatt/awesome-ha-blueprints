description: Integrate a wide set of controllers in Home Assistant and provide an easy to use interface to run custom actions on a controller event.

:::tip
Controllers are part of the **Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem**. You can read more about this topic [here](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem).
:::

**Controllers** are blueprints which allow to easily integrate a wide range of controllers (wall switches, remotes, dimmers, etc.) and use them to run a set of actions when interacting with them. They consist in a practical abstraction layer for easily building controlled-based automations without worrying about the handling of RAW controller events, and the integration used to connect controllers to Home Assistant (Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, etc.).

You can integrate Controllers with [Hooks](hooks) and create controller-based automations to control lights, media players and much more, without having to write a single line of code.
