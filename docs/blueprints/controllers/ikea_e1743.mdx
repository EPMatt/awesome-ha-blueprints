## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA E1743 On/Off Switch & Dimmer. Supports controllers integrated with deCONZ, ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller itself.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1743#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement id='deconz'  />
<Requirement id='zha'  />
<Requirement id='zigbee2mqtt'  />
<Requirement  name='Input Text Integration' required='ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT, Double press action'>

This integration provides the entity which will be used to store the last button event. It's required when using ZHA to integrate the remote, as well as when using double press events. This should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.

## Available Hooks

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.
Please enable double press events for the Up and Down button to use all the available actions.

- Up button short press -> Turn on
- Up button long press & hold -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)
- Up button double press -> Color Up
- Down button short press -> Turn off
- Down button long pres & hold -> Brightness down (continuous, until release)
- Down button double press -> Color Down

[Light Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/light)

### Media Player

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.
Please enable double press events for the Up and Down button to use all the available actions.

- Up button short press -> Volume up
- Up button long press & hold -> Volume up (continuous, until release)
- Up button double press -> Next track
- Down button short press -> Volume down
- Down button long press & hold -> Volume down (continuous, until release)
- Down button double press -> Play/Pause

### Cover

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a cover. Supports opening, closing and tilting the cover.
Please enable double press events for the Down button to use all the available actions.

- Up button short press -> Open cover
- Up button long press -> Open cover tilt
- Down button short press -> Close cover
- Down button long press -> Close cover tilt
- Down button double press -> Stop cover and cover tilt

## Additional Notes

The reason why a text input is required to store the last long press event when using a remote with ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT is because of the actions mapping for the controller with these integrations. Natively, the controller doesn't allow to distinguish between different button release events, so the blueprint must store the previous clicked button, using the text input. Make sure the input text is not altered by any other agents, since this could break the automation.

It's also important to notice that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. This blueprint provides virtual double press events by relying on the text input, used to store the last short press event, and a delay, which represents the maximum time gap between the first and second short press required to trigger the virtual double press.

When double press events are enabled for a specific button, clicking the button results in the automation first waiting for the second button press, then, if none is received within the provided delay, executing the short press action.

If double press events are disabled for a specific button, the corresponding single press action will be executed immediately when the button is pressed.
