## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA E1812 Shortcut button. Supports controllers integrated with deCONZ, ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller itself.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1812#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement id='deconz'  />
<Requirement id='zha'  />
<Requirement id='zigbee2mqtt'  />
<Requirement  name='Input Text Integration' required='Double press action'>

This integration provides the entity which will be used to store the last button event. It's required when using ZHA to integrate the remote, as well as when using double press events. This should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.

## Available Hooks

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.
Please enable double button press events to use all the available actions.

- Button short press -> Toggle
- Button double press -> Color up

[Light Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/light)

### Media Player

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.
Please enable double button press events to use all the available actions.

- Button short press -> Play/Pause
- Button long press -> Stop
- Button double press -> Next track

[Media Player Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/media_player)

### Cover

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a cover. Supports opening, closing and tilting the cover.
Please enable double button press events to use all the available actions.

- Button short press -> Open Cover
- Button long press -> Stop cover and cover tilt
- Button double press -> Close cover

[Cover Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/cover)

## Additional Notes

It's also important to notice that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. This blueprint provides virtual double press events by relying on the text input, used to store the last short press event, and a delay, which represents the maximum time gap between the first and second short press required to trigger the virtual double press.

When double press events are enabled for a specific button, clicking the button results in the automation first waiting for the second button press, then, if none is received within the provided delay, executing the short press action.

If double press events are disabled for a specific button, the corresponding single press action will be executed immediately when the button is pressed.

## Changelog

- **2021-03-14**: first blueprint version :tada:
- **2021-03-25**: :warning: **Breaking Change**: standardize input names across all the Controller blueprints.
  If you plan to update this blueprint, please update the inputs in your automations as follows:
  - `remote` -> `controller_device`
  - `zigbee2mqtt_remote` -> `controller_entity`
  - `helper_last_loop_event_input` -> `helper_last_controller_event`
