## Description

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a cover. Supports opening, closing and tilting the cover.
:::info
An automation created with this blueprint must be linked to a [Controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers) automation. Controllers are blueprints which allow to easily integrate a wide range of controllers and use them to run a set of actions when interacting with them. They expose an abstract interface used by Hooks to create controller-based automations.

See the list of [Controllers supported by this Hook](#supported-controllers) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement id='controller' required/>
<Requirement name='Cover Integration' required>

This integration provides the entity which represents a cover in Home Assistant. It should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.
