## Description

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a cover. Supports opening, closing and tilting the cover.
:::info
An automation created with this blueprint must be linked to a [Controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers) automation. Controllers are blueprints which allow to easily integrate a wide range of controllers and use them to run a set of actions when interacting with them. They expose an abstract interface used by Hooks to create controller-based automations.

See the list of [Controllers supported by this Hook](/docs/blueprints/hooks/cover#supported-controllers) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement
id='controller'
required
/>
<Requirement  name='Cover Integration' required>

This integration provides the entity which represents a cover in Home Assistant. It should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.

</Requirement>

## Inputs

<Input
  name='Controller device'
  description='The controller device which will control the light. Choose a value only if the integration used to connect the controller to Home Assistant exposes it as a Device. This value should match the one specified in the corresponding Controller automation.'
  selector='device'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Controller entity'
  description='The controller entity which will control the light. Choose a value only if the integration used to connect the controller to Home Assistant exposes it as an Entity. This value should match the one specified in the corresponding Controller automation.'
  selector='entity'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Controller model'
  description='The model for the controller used in this automation. Choose a value from the list of supported controllers.'
  selector='select'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Cover'
  description='Cover which will be controlled with this automation.'
  selector='entity'
  required
/>

## Supported Controllers

- [IKEA E1524/E1810 5-Button Remote](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1524_e1810)
- [IKEA E1743 On/Off Switch & Dimmer](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1743)
- [IKEA E1812 Shortcut button](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1812)

## Additional Notes

If you want to link multiple covers to the same controller you can either use [Cover Groups](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cover.group/) or build multiple Hooks linked to the same Controller.
