## Description

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.
:::info
An automation created with this blueprint must be linked to a [Controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers) automation. Controllers are blueprints which allow to easily integrate a wide range of controllers and use them to run a set of actions when interacting with them. They expose an abstract interface used by Hooks to create controller-based automations.

See the list of [Controllers supported by this Hook](/docs/blueprints/hooks/media_player#supported-controllers) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement
id='controller'
required
/>
<Requirement  name='Media Player Integration' required>

This integration provides the entity which represents a media player in Home Assistant. It should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.

</Requirement>

## Inputs

<Input
  name='Controller device'
  description='The controller device which will control the light. Choose a value only if the integration used to connect the controller to Home Assistant exposes it as a Device. This value should match the one specified in the corresponding Controller automation.'
  selector='device'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Controller entity'
  description='The controller entity which will control the light. Choose a value only if the integration used to connect the controller to Home Assistant exposes it as an Entity. This value should match the one specified in the corresponding Controller automation.'
  selector='entity'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Controller model'
  description='The model for the controller used in this automation. Choose a value from the list of supported controllers.'
  selector='select'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Media Player'
  description='Media player which will be controlled with this automation.'
  selector='entity'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Volume steps - short actions'
  description='Number of steps from min to max volume when controlling volume with short actions (eg. button press), if the media player supports it.'
  selector='number'
/>
<Input
  name='Volume steps - long actions'
  description='Number of steps from min to max volume when controlling volume with long actions (eg. button hold or controller rotation), if the media player supports it.'
  selector='number'
/>

- [IKEA E1812 Shortcut button](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1812)
- [IKEA ICTC-G-1 TRADFRI wireless dimmer](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_ictc_g_1)
- [Osram SMART+ Switch Mini](/docs/blueprints/controllers/osram_ac025xx00nj)

- [Philips Hue Smart Button](/docs/blueprints/controllers/philips_8718699693985)

## Additional Notes

Not all media players support the customization of the number of steps for volume control, due to the fact that some of them do not expose their current volume level to Home Assistant. In these situations, the automation will fallback to the `media_player.volume_up` and `media_player.volume_down` services.
