## Description

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.
:::info
An automation created with this blueprint must be linked to a [Controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers) automation. Controllers are blueprints which allow to easily integrate a wide range of controllers and use them to run a set of actions when interacting with them. They expose an abstract interface used by Hooks to create controller-based automations.

See the list of [Controllers supported by this Hook](/docs/blueprints/hooks/light#supported-controllers) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement
id='controller'
required
/>
<Requirement  name='Light Integration' required>

This integration provides the entity which represents a light in Home Assistant. It should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.

</Requirement>

## Inputs

<Input
  name='Controller Device'
  description='The controller device which will control the light. Choose a value only if the integration used to connect the controller to Home Assistant exposes it as a Device. This value should match the one specified in the corresponding Controller automation.'
  selector='device'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Controller Entity'
  description='The controller entity which will control the light. Choose a value only if the integration used to connect the controller to Home Assistant exposes it as an Entity. This value should match the one specified in the corresponding Controller automation.'
  selector='entity'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Controller model'
  description='The model for the controller used in this automation.'
  selector='select'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Light'
  description='Light which will be controlled with this automation.'
  selector='entity'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Light color mode'
  description='Specify how the controller will set the light color. Choose "Color Temperature" and "Hue - Saturation" depending on the features supported by your light. If you are not sure you can select "Auto".'
  selector='select'
/>
<Input
  name='Light Transition'
  description='Number that represents the time (in milliseconds) the light should take turn on or off, if the light supports it.'
  selector='number'
/>
<Input
  name='Light minimum brightness'
  description='The minimum brightness the light can be set with this automation.'
  selector='number'
/>
<Input
  name='Light maximum brightness'
  description='The maximum brightness the light can be set with this automation.'
  selector='number'
/>
<Input
  name='Light brightness steps - short actions'
  description='Number of steps from min to max brightness when controlling brightness with short actions (eg. button press).'
  selector='number'
/>
<Input
  name='Light brightness steps - long actions'
  description='Number of steps from min to max brightness when controlling brightness with long actions (eg. button hold or controller rotation).'
  selector='number'
/>
<Input
  name='Force brightness value at turn on'
  description='Force brightness to the "On brightness" input value, when the light is being turned on.'
  selector='boolean'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='On brightness'
  description='Brightness value to force when turning on the light'
  selector='number'
  required

## Supported Controllers

- [IKEA E1524/E1810 5-Button Remote](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1524_e1810)
- [IKEA E1743 On/Off Switch & Dimmer](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1743)
- [IKEA E1744 SYMFONISK Rotary Remote](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1744)
- [IKEA E1812 Shortcut button](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1812)

## Additional Notes

If you want to link multiple lights to the same controller you can either use [Light Groups](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.group/) or build multiple Hooks linked to the same Controller.
