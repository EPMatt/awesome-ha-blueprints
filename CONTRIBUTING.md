## Blueprint Guidelines

To ensure the delivery of good quality, highly reusable blueprints which can be widely adopted across the community, blueprints must adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Clarity and Descriptiveness**: don't use ambiguous names and identifiers. Include clear descriptions for both the blueprint and its inputs.
- **Flexibility**: your blueprint must be as general as possible, and should adapt to different use-cases. Consider different conditions and effectively handle corner cases.
- **Effective Testing**: make sure to conduct proper testing before submitting your contribution.
- **Input Restriction**: use selectors to restrict what users can provide as input to the blueprint.
- **Code Documentation**: if the blueprint contains a complicated piece of code, consider adding some YAML comments to better explain what the section is trying to achieve.
- **Consistency**: be consistent within your blueprint, for what regards naming and patterns you use to accomplish certain tasks. Also, adhere to the format of the provided templates.

## Development Setup

This repository uses **DevContainers** to provide a fully automated development environment. When you open the project in a supported environment (such as VS Code with the Dev Containers extension or GitHub Codespaces), the container automatically installs all dependencies and configures the development tools.

### Requirements for DevContainers

To use DevContainers, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the **Dev Containers** extension  
  _(Alternatively, you can use GitHub Codespaces, which supports DevContainers natively.)_

### Automated Code Formatting

- **Husky** and **Lint-Staged** ensure code is formatted correctly before each commit.
- Any staged files are automatically linted and formatted, preventing inconsistent styles from being committed.

To start developing, simply open the repository in a compatible DevContainer environment, and everything will be set up automatically! ðŸš€
