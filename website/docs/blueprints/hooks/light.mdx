## Description

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.
:::info
An automation created with this blueprint must be linked to a [Controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers) automation. Controllers are blueprints which allow to easily integrate a wide range of controllers and use them to run a set of actions when interacting with them. They expose an abstract interface used by Hooks to create controller-based automations.

See the list of [Controllers supported by this Hook](#supported-controllers) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement id='controller' required/>
<Requirement name='Light Integration' required>

This integration provides the entity which represents a light in Home Assistant. It should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.

</Requirement>

## Inputs

<Input
  name='Controller Device'

<Input
  name='Smooth power on'
  description='Force the light to turn on at minimum brightness when a brightness up command (single or continuous) is triggered and light is off.'
  selector='boolean'
/>
<Input
  name='Smooth power off'
  description='Allow a brightness down command (single or continuous) to turn off the light when at minimum brightness. Disabling this will prevent the light from being turned off by brightness down commands.'
  selector='boolean'
/>

## Additional Notes

If you want to link multiple lights to the same controller you can either use [Light Groups](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.group/) or build multiple Hooks linked to the same Controller.
