## Description

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a cover. Supports opening, closing and tilting the cover.
:::info
An automation created with this blueprint must be linked to a [Controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers) automation. Controllers are blueprints which allow to easily integrate a wide range of controllers and use them to run a set of actions when interacting with them. They expose an abstract interface used by Hooks to create controller-based automations.

See the list of [Controllers supported by this Hook](#supported-controllers) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement id='controller' required/>
<Requirement name='Cover Integration' required>

This integration provides the entity which represents a cover in Home Assistant. It should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.

</Requirement>

## Inputs

<Input
  name='Controller Device'
  description='The controller device which will control the Cover. Choose a value only if the integration used to connect the controller to Home Assistant exposes it as a Device. This value should match the one specified in the corresponding Controller automation.'
  selector='device'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Controller Entity'
  description='The controller entity which will control the Cover. Choose a value only if the integration used to connect the controller to Home Assistant exposes it as an Entity. This value should match the one specified in the corresponding Controller automation.'
  selector='entity'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Controller model'
  description='The model for the controller used in this automation. Choose a value from the list of supported controllers.'
  selector='select'
  required
/>
<Input
  name='Cover'
  description='Cover which will be controlled with this automation.'
  selector='entity'
  required
/>

## Additional Notes

If you want to link multiple covers to the same controller you can either use [Cover Groups](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cover.group/) or build multiple Hooks linked to the same Controller.

## Changelog

- **2021-03-26**: first blueprint version :tada:
- **2021-04-19**: remove unused variable, fix warnings for undefined variables in Home Assistant Core >=2021.4.0
- **2021-08-02**: Improve inputs documentation and organization
- **2021-10-26**:
  - Standardize blueprints structure and inputs naming across the whole collection.
  - Improve blueprint documentation.
  - :tada: Add support for alternate mappings. Additional mappings for currently supported controllers will be added from now on. Refer to the documentation of your controller for more details.
  - :warning: **Breaking Change**: update controller names in the `Controller Model` input, to match the full name of controllers, prevent ambiguities and enable support for alternate mappings. After updating this blueprint, please reconfigure your automations by selecting again the value for the `Controller Model` input, matching the full name of the controller you're using with this hook.
