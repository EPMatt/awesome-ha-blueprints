## Description

Send a notification to the provided mobile devices whenever an update for the given Home Assistant add-on is available.
Supports full notification customization, notification groups, auto-dismissal when the add-on is updated and button for starting the update directly from your notification tray, with optional notification after the update completed succesfully.
This blueprint doesn't require any additional sensor to be manually set up, since it uses the built-in add-on sensors introduced with the Supervisor integration starting from Home Assistant Core 2021.4.0.

## Requirements

<Requirement name='Home Assistant Supervisor + Integration' required>

To use this blueprint you must have an Home Assistant instance running installed as Home Assistant Managed OS or Home Assistant Supervised.
You can learn more about Home Assistant installation methods in the

[official Home Assistant docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/).

You must also have the Home Assistant Supervisor integration enabled and correctly set up. This is available and enabled by default starting from Home Assistant Core 2021.4.0.

Moreover, add-on sensors are disabled by default in the Supervisor integration. Please make sure to enable the following entities for the add-on you plan to track before setting up this blueprint:

- `sensor.<addon>_version`
- `sensor.<addon>_newest_version`
- `binary_sensor.<addon>_update_available`

#### How to enable add-on entities

1. Navigate to _Configuration_ -> _Integrations_ in your Home Assistant UI. You can click the following button to navigate to the Integrations dashboard for your installation.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your integrations.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/integrations.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/) 2. Click on _Entities_ in the _Home Assistant Supervisor_ card you find in the Integrations page. You'll be presented with a table of entities exposed by the Supervisor integration. 3. Select all the entities you want to use with this blueprint, then hit _Enable Selected_ on the top right of the table. 4. You've succesfully enabled the add-on entities required by this blueprint.

<Requirement name='Mobile App Integration' required>

This integration provides the service to send notification to mobile devices. This should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.

</Requirement>
<Requirement name='Home Assistant Companion App' required>

The official mobile app for Home Assistant. Make sure to have the Home Assistant Companion App installed and configured on mobile devices you plan to use for this automation.

</Requirement>
<Requirement name='Notify Group Integration' required>

If you want to simultaneously send the notification to multiple devices, you can define a notification group using this integration in your `configuration.yaml`, then provide the service for the notification group in the [Mobile devices notification service input](#mobile-devices-notification-service). This integration should be enabled by default. More on how to setup notification groups in the official docs.
