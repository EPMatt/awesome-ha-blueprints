Hooks are part of the **Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem**. You can read more about this topic [here](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem).

**Hooks** are blueprints which seamlessly integrate with [Controllers](controllers) to enable control of lights, media players and much more, without having to write a single line of code.

While Controllers are responsible for integrating the hardware and exposing an abstract interface to the user, Hooks can link to this interface and listen for events fired by a controller, taking care of providing the actual control functionality for common use cases.
