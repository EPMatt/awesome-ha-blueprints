## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA E1743 TRÅDFRI On/Off Switch & Dimmer. Supports controllers integrated with deCONZ, ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller itself.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1743#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Available Hooks

:::note Virtual double press actions
Some of the following mappings might include actions for virtual double press events, which are disabled by default.
If you are using a hook mapping which provides an action for a virtual double press event, please make sure to enable support for virtual double press on the corresponding buttons with the corresponding blueprint input.
:::

### Light

#### Default Mapping

- Up button short press -> Turn on
- Up button long press -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)
- Up button double press -> Color up
- Down button short press -> Turn off
- Down button long press -> Brightness down (continuous, until release)
- Down button double press -> Color down

#### Mapping #2

- Up button short press -> Brightness up
- Up button long press -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)

## Additional Notes

### Helper - Last Controller Event

The `helper_last_controller_event` (Helper - Last Controller Event) input serves as a permanent storage area for the automation. The stored info is used to implement the blueprint's core functionality. To learn more about the helper, how it's used and why it's required, you can read the dedicated section in the [Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#helper---last-controller-event-input).

The helper is used to determine button release events when the controller is integrated with ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT, because of the actions mapping for the controller with these integrations. Natively, the controller doesn't allow to distinguish between different button release events, so the blueprint must store the previous clicked button.

### Virtual double press events

It's also important to note that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. Instead , this blueprint provides virtual double press events. You can read more about them in the [general Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#virtual-events).

## Changelog

- **2021-02-07**: first blueprint version :tada:
- **2021-02-07**: fix an issue on Zigbee2MQTT triggering rules
- **2021-02-07**: fix an issue which prevented to create automations for ZHA or deCONZ (thanks @kks36! :tada: ).
- **2021-02-08**: update example, fix an issue which executed actions twice when the remote was connected via Zigbee2MQTT.
- **2021-02-23**:
  - add support for virtual double press events
  - block automation runs for empty and repeated messages
  - reduce `input_text helper` writes
- **2021-03-03**: move the blueprint in the Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem. See announcement [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/awesome-ha-blueprints-a-curated-list-of-blueprints-easily-create-controller-based-automations-remotes-switches-for-controlling-lights-media-players-and-more/256687/7). :tada:
- **2021-03-25**: :warning: **Breaking Change**: standardize input names across all the Controller blueprints.
  If you plan to update this blueprint, please update the inputs in your automations as follows:
  - `remote` -> `controller_device`
  - `zigbee2mqtt_remote` -> `controller_entity`
  - `action_*` inputs -> `action_button_*`
  - `helper_last_loop_event_input` -> `helper_last_controller_event`
- **2021-03-26**: add support for the Cover Hook
- **2021-04-19**: Fix double press events not being detected with deCONZ
- **2021-04-23**: Fix deCONZ events not being recognized
- **2021-05-26**:

  :warning: **Breaking Change**:

  `helper_last_controller_event` is now a mandatory input. It also simplifies the blueprint setup (reducing issues due to improper configuration missing the helper, which was required only in certain conditions as was stated in the docs), and provides support for advanced features which might be developed in the future.

  If you plan to update this blueprint, please make sure to provide a valid `input_text` entity for the `helper_last_controller_event` input. You should create a separate `input_text` for each Controller blueprint you're configuring, since using the same for multiple automation could lead to inconsistencies and undefined behaviour.

  **Other changes:**

  - :tada: Add Debouncing support. Debouncing avoids duplicate action runs which might occur with certain controllers and integrations. The feature is disabled by default, check the documentation to find out how to enable it
  - Prevent undesired endless loops, which might occur in rare cases when the corresponding stop event is not received, by running loop actions a finite number of times, customizable with two new blueprint inputs
  - Fix inputs wrongly marked as required
  - Fix for Zigbee2MQTT reporting null state changes

- **2021-07-04**: Fix deCONZ button release events not being properly recognized
- **2021-08-02**: Improve inputs documentation and organization
- **2021-10-26**: Standardize blueprints structure and inputs naming across the whole collection. Improve blueprint documentation. No functionality change.
- **2022-08-08**: Optimize characters usage for the `helper_last_controller_event` text input.
- **2025-01-02**: Remove spaces to match new helper format in Home Assistant 2023.5.x. ([@LordSushiPhoenix](https://github.com/LordSushiPhoenix))
- **2025-01-10**: Add Support for Zigbee2MQTT MQTT device triggers, preserving backwards compatability with legacy sensor action events. ([@yarafie](https://github.com/yarafie))
