## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA E1766 TRÅDFRI Open/Close Remote. Supports controllers integrated with deCONZ, ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller itself.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1766#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Available Hooks

:::note Virtual double press actions
Some of the following mappings might include actions for virtual double press events, which are disabled by default.
If you are using a hook mapping which provides an action for a virtual double press event, please make sure to enable support for virtual double press on the corresponding buttons with the corresponding blueprint input.

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.

#### Default Mapping

- Up button short press -> Brightness up
- Up button double press -> Turn on
- Down button short press -> Brightness down
- Down button double press -> Turn off

#### Mapping #2

- Up button short press -> Brightness up
- Up button double press -> Color up
- Down button short press -> Brightness down
- Down button double press -> Color down

[Light Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/light)

### Media Player

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.

#### Default Mapping

- Up button short press -> Volume up
- Up button double press -> Next track
- Down button short press -> Volume down
- Down button double press -> Play/Pause

[Media Player Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/media_player)

### Cover

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a cover. Supports opening, closing and tilting the cover.

#### Default Mapping

- Up button short press -> Open cover
- Down button short press -> Close cover
- Down button double press -> Stop cover and cover tilt

## Additional Notes

### Helper - Last Controller Event

The `helper_last_controller_event` (Helper - Last Controller Event) input serves as a permanent storage area for the automation. The stored info is used to implement the blueprint's core functionality. To learn more about the helper, how it's used and why it's required, you can read the dedicated section in the [Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#helper---last-controller-event-input).

### Virtual double press events

It's also important to note that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. Instead , this blueprint provides virtual double press events. You can read more about them in the [general Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#virtual-events).

### Hooks support and missing long press events

Due to the controller not exposing long press events but only short and release events, it's not possible to determine the nature of a button press. Therefore, to prevent an erroneous behaviour, Hooks only rely on short and virtual double press events to implement their functionality for this controller.

## Changelog

- **2021-10-29**: first blueprint version :tada:
- **2022-08-08**: Optimize characters usage for the `helper_last_controller_event` text input.
