## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA E1812 TRÅDFRI Shortcut button. Supports controllers integrated with deCONZ, ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller itself.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1812#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Available Hooks

:::note Virtual double press actions
Some of the following mappings might include actions for virtual double press events, which are disabled by default.
If you are using a hook mapping which provides an action for a virtual double press event, please make sure to enable support for virtual double press on the corresponding buttons with the corresponding blueprint input.
:::

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.

#### Default Mapping

- Button short press -> Toggle
- Button double press -> Color up

[Light Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/light)

### Media Player

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.

#### Default Mapping

- Button short press -> Play/Pause
- Button long press -> Stop
- Button double press -> Next track

[Media Player Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/media_player)

### Cover

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a cover. Supports opening, closing and tilting the cover.

#### Default Mapping

- Button short press -> Open cover
- Button long press -> Stop cover and cover tilt
- Button double press -> Close cover

[Cover Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/cover)

## Additional Notes

### Helper - Last Controller Event

The `helper_last_controller_event` (Helper - Last Controller Event) input serves as a permanent storage area for the automation. The stored info is used to implement the blueprint's core functionality. To learn more about the helper, how it's used and why it's required, you can read the dedicated section in the [Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#helper---last-controller-event-input).

### Virtual double press events

It's also important to note that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. Instead , this blueprint provides virtual double press events. You can read more about them in the [general Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#virtual-events).

## Changelog

- **2021-03-14**: first blueprint version :tada:
- **2021-03-25**: :warning: **Breaking Change**: standardize input names across all the Controller blueprints.
  If you plan to update this blueprint, please update the inputs in your automations as follows:
  - `remote` -> `controller_device`
  - `zigbee2mqtt_remote` -> `controller_entity`
  - `helper_last_loop_event_input` -> `helper_last_controller_event`
- **2021-03-26**: add support for the Cover Hook
- **2021-04-19**: Fix double press events not being detected with deCONZ
- **2021-04-23**: Fix deCONZ events not being recognized
- **2021-05-15**:

  :warning: **Breaking Change**:

  `helper_last_controller_event` is now a mandatory input. It also simplifies the blueprint setup (reducing issues due to improper configuration missing the helper, which was required only in certain conditions as was stated in the docs), and provides support for advanced features which might be developed in the future.

  If you plan to update this blueprint, please make sure to provide a valid `input_text` entity for the `helper_last_controller_event` input. You should create a separate `input_text` for each Controller blueprint you're configuring, since using the same for multiple automation could lead to inconsistencies and undefined behaviour.

  **Other changes:**

  - :tada: Add Debouncing support. Debouncing avoids duplicate action runs which might occur with certain controllers and integrations. The feature is disabled by default, check the documentation to find out how to enable it
  - Prevent undesired endless loops, which might occur in rare cases when the corresponding stop event is not received, by running loop actions a finite number of times, customizable with a new blueprint input
  - Fix inputs wrongly marked as required

- **2021-05-26**: Fix for Zigbee2MQTT reporting null state changes
- **2021-08-02**: Improve inputs documentation and organization
- **2021-10-26**: Standardize blueprints structure and inputs naming across the whole collection. Improve blueprint documentation. No functionality change.
- **2022-08-08**: Optimize characters usage for the `helper_last_controller_event` text input.
