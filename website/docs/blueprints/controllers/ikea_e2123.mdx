## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA E2123 SYMFONISK sound remote, gen 2. Supports controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, deCONZ. The blueprint will automagically detect the integration type and take care of all the rest.

The blueprint handles double button press events natively for the dots1/dots2 buttons as it is supported by the controller device itself.
Long and Double press events can be enabled/disabled for each of the dots1/dots2 buttons to get extra speed in recognizing single press events.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with lights, media players, covers and maybe more in the future. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e2123#available-hooks) for additional details.
