## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA E2001/E2002 STYRBAR Remote control. Supports controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, deCONZ. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller itself.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e2001_e2002#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement id='zigbee2mqtt'/>
<Requirement id='zha'/>
<Requirement id='deconz'/>
<Requirement name='Input Text Integration' required>

This integration provides the entity which must be provided to the blueprint in the **Helper - Last Controller Event** input. Learn more about this helper by reading the dedicated section in the [Additional Notes](#helper---last-controller-event).

## Inputs

<Inputs category='controllers' id='ikea_e2001_e2002' />

## Available Hooks

:::note Virtual double press actions
Some of the following mappings might include actions for virtual double press events, which are disabled by default.
If you are using a hook mapping which provides an action for a virtual double press event, please make sure to enable support for virtual double press on the corresponding buttons with the corresponding blueprint input.

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.

#### Default Mapping

- Up button short press -> Turn on
- Up button long press -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)
- Down button short press -> Turn off
- Down button long press -> Brightness down (continuous, until release)
- Left button short press -> Color down
- Left button long press -> Color down (continuous, until release)
- Right button short press -> Color up
- Right button long press -> Color up (continuous, until release)

#### Mapping #2

- Up button short press -> Brightness up
- Up button long press -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)
- Up button double press `Virtual` -> Turn on
- Down button short press -> Brightness down
- Down button long press -> Brightness down (continuous, until release)
- Down button double press `Virtual` -> Turn off
- Left button short press -> Color down
- Left button long press -> Color down (continuous, until release)
- Right button short press -> Color up
- Right button long press -> Color up (continuous, until release)

### Media Player

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.

#### Default Mapping

- Up button short press -> Play/Pause
- Up button long press -> Volume up (continuous, until release)
- Down button short press -> Stop
- Down button long press -> Volume down (continuous, until release)
- Left button short press -> Previous track
- Right button short press -> Next track

## Additional Notes

### Helper - Last Controller Event

The `helper_last_controller_event` (Helper - Last Controller Event) input serves as a permanent storage area for the automation. The stored info is used to implement the blueprint's core functionality. To learn more about the helper, how it's used and why it's required, you can read the dedicated section in the [Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#helper---last-controller-event-input).

The helper is used to determine button release events when the controller is integrated with Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, because of the actions mapping for the controller with these integrations. Natively, the controller doesn't allow to distinguish between different button release events, so the blueprint must store the previous clicked button.

### Virtual double press events

It's also important to note that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. Instead , this blueprint provides virtual double press events. You can read more about them in the [general Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#virtual-events).

### Issues with Zigbee2MQTT and the device firing duplicate events

It has been reported that IKEA E2001/E2002 controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT might fire duplicate events from time to time, during interaction. This issue is not relative to the blueprint itself.

If you notice your controller is not behaving as expected please reset the device and repeat the pairing process with Zigbee2MQTT, then try again.

## Changelog

- **2021-11-07**: first blueprint version :tada:
- **2022-08-08**: Optimize characters usage for the `helper_last_controller_event` text input.
- **2025-01-02**:
  - (ZHA) Fixed a bug preventing long pressing actions to be triggered. ([@Ivarvdb](https://github.com/Ivarvdb))
  - (Zigbee2MQTT) handle "unknown" state. ([@beardhatcode](https://github.com/beardhatcode))
- **2025-01-03**: Remove spaces to match new helper format in Home Assistant 2023.5.x. ([@LordSushiPhoenix](https://github.com/LordSushiPhoenix))
- **2025-02-13**:

  :warning: **Breaking Change**:

  Migrate to Zigbee2MQTT MQTT Device Triggers. ([@yarafie](https://github.com/yarafie))

  The `controller_entity` input has been deprecated, and `controller_device` is now mandatory.
  If you are a Zigbee2MQTT user and plan to update this blueprint, please make sure to remove the `controller_entity` input from your automation config and add the device ID of your controller to the `controller_device` input.
  To obtain the device ID from your controller, configure the automation from the UI and use the device selector dropdown on the `controller_device` input to select your controller.

- **2025-03-20**: Standardized input naming format for controller devices and virtual button actions. No functionality changes.
