## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided Philips 8718699693985 Hue Smart Button. Supports controllers integrated with deCONZ, ZHA. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller itself.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/philips_8718699693985#available-hooks) for additional details.

  description='Loop the button action until the button is released.'
  selector='boolean'
/>
<Input
  name='Button long press - Maximum loop repeats'
  description='Maximum number of repeats for the custom action, when looping is enabled. Use it as a safety limit to prevent an endless loop in case the corresponding stop event is not received.'
  selector='number'

<Input
  name='Expose button double press event'

  selector='boolean'
/>
<Input
  name='Helper - Double Press delay'
  description='Max delay between the first and the second button press for the double press event. Provide a value only if you are using a double press action. Increase this value if you notice that the double press action is not triggered properly.'
  selector='number'
/>
<Input
  name='Helper - Debounce delay'
  description='Delay used for debouncing RAW controller events, by default set to 0. A value of 0 disables the debouncing feature. Increase this value if you notice custom actions or linked Hooks running multiple times when interacting with the device. When the controller needs to be debounced, usually a value of 100 is enough to remove all duplicate events.'
  selector='number'

## Available Hooks

:::note Virtual double press actions
Some of the following mappings might include actions for virtual double press events, which are disabled by default.
If you are using a hook mapping which provides an action for a virtual double press event, please make sure to enable support for virtual double press on the corresponding buttons with the corresponding blueprint input.
:::

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.

#### Default Mapping

- Button short press -> Toggle

[Light Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/light)

### Media Player

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.

#### Default Mapping

- Button short press -> Play/Pause
- Button double press -> Next track

[Media Player Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/media_player)

## Additional Notes

### Helper - Last Controller Event

The `helper_last_controller_event` (Helper - Last Controller Event) input serves as a permanent storage area for the automation. The stored info is used to implement the blueprint's core functionality. To learn more about the helper, how it's used and why it's required, you can read the dedicated section in the [Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#helper---last-controller-event-input).

### Virtual double press events

It's also important to note that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. Instead , this blueprint provides virtual double press events. You can read more about them in the [general Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#virtual-events).
