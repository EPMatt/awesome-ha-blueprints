## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided Xiaomi WXCJKG12LM Aqara Opple 4 button remote. Supports controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, deCONZ. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/xiaomi_wxcjkg12lm#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Additional Notes

### Helper - Last Controller Event

The `helper_last_controller_event` (Helper - Last Controller Event) input serves as a permanent storage area for the automation. The stored info is used to implement the blueprint's core functionality. To learn more about the helper, how it's used and why it's required, you can read the dedicated section in the [Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#helper---last-controller-event-input).

## Changelog

- **2021-12-03**: first blueprint version :tada:
- **2022-08-08**: Optimize characters usage for the `helper_last_controller_event` text input.
- **2025-02-13**:

  :warning: **Breaking Change**:

  Migrate to Zigbee2MQTT MQTT Device Triggers. ([@yarafie](https://github.com/yarafie))

  The `controller_entity` input has been deprecated, and `controller_device` is now mandatory.
  If you are a Zigbee2MQTT user and plan to update this blueprint, please make sure to remove the `controller_entity` input from your automation config and add the device ID of your controller to the `controller_device` input.
  To obtain the device ID from your controller, configure the automation from the UI and use the device selector dropdown on the `controller_device` input to select your controller.

- **2025-03-20**: Standardized input naming format for controller devices and virtual button actions. No functionality changes.
