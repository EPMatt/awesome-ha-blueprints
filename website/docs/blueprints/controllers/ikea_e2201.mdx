## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA E2201 RODRET Dimmer. Supports controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, deCONZ. The blueprint will automagically detect the integration type and take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller itself.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e2201#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Available Hooks

:::note Virtual double press actions
Some of the following mappings might include actions for virtual double press events, which are disabled by default.
If you are using a hook mapping which provides an action for a virtual double press event, please make sure to enable support for virtual double press on the corresponding buttons with the corresponding blueprint input.

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.

#### Default Mapping

- Up button short press -> Turn on
- Up button long press -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)
- Up button double press `Virtual` -> Color up
- Down button short press -> Turn off
- Down button long press -> Brightness down (continuous, until release)
- Down button double press `Virtual` -> Color down

#### Mapping #2

- Up button short press -> Brightness up
- Up button long press -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)
- Up button double press `Virtual` -> Turn on
- Down button short press -> Brightness down
- Down button long press -> Brightness down (continuous, until release)
- Down button double press `Virtual` -> Turn off

### Media Player

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.

#### Default Mapping

- Up button short press -> Volume up
- Up button long press -> Volume up (continuous, until release)
- Up button double press `Virtual` -> Next track
- Down button short press -> Volume down
- Down button long press -> Volume down
- Down button double press `Virtual` -> Play/Pause

### Cover

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a cover. Supports opening, closing and tilting the cover.

#### Default Mapping

- Up button short press -> Open cover
- Up button long press -> Open the cover tilt
- Down button short press -> Close cover
- Down button long press -> Close the cover tilt
- Down button double press `Virtual` -> Stop cover and cover tilt

## Additional Notes

### Virtual double press events

It's important to note that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. Instead , this blueprint provides virtual double press events. You can read more about them in the [general Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#virtual-events).

## Changelog

- **2025-03-20**: Initial release. ([@yarafie](https://github.com/yarafie)) :tada:
- **2025-03-20b**: Fix automation triggers. ([@yarafie](https://github.com/yarafie))
- **2025-03-20c**: Standardized input naming format for controller devices and virtual button actions. No functionality changes.
