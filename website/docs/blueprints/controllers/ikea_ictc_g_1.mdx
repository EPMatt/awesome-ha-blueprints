## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA ICTC-G-1 TRÅDFRI wireless dimmer. Supports controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, deCONZ. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to optionally loop the rotate actions while the remote is rotating either left or right. Once the remote stops rotating, the loop stops as well. This is useful when rotating the controller should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_ictc_g_1#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement id='zigbee2mqtt'>
<Requirement id='zha'/>
<Requirement id='deconz'/>

When configuring the remote with Zigbee2MQTT make sure to disable the legacy integration for it, as reported [here](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/ICTC-G-1.html#legacy-integration). This blueprint won't work with controllers with a legacy integration due to their instability and fundamental problems.

</Requirement>
<Requirement name='Input Text Integration' required>

This integration provides the entity which must be provided to the blueprint in the **Helper - Last Controller Event** input. Learn more about this helper by reading the dedicated section in the [Additional Notes](#helper---last-controller-event).

## Inputs

<Inputs category='controllers' id='ikea_ictc_g_1' />

## Available Hooks

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.

#### Default Mapping

- Rotate left -> Brightness down (continuous, until stop)
- Rotate right -> Brightness up (continuous, until stop)

[Light Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/light)

### Media Player

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.

#### Default Mapping

- Rotate left -> Volume down (continuous, until stop)
- Rotate right -> Volume up (continuous, until stop)

[Media Player Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/media_player)

## Additional Notes

### Helper - Last Controller Event

The `helper_last_controller_event` (Helper - Last Controller Event) input serves as a permanent storage area for the automation. The stored info is used to implement the blueprint's core functionality. To learn more about the helper, how it's used and why it's required, you can read the dedicated section in the [Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#helper---last-controller-event-input).

The helper is used to determine stop rotation events when the controller is integrated with Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, because of the actions mapping for the controller with these integrations. Natively, the controller doesn't allow to distinguish between different rotation events, so the blueprint must store the previous rotation.

This blueprint provides beta support for controllers integrated with deCONZ, since not all the supported events are mapped for this integration. If you are using the IKEA ICTC-G-1 with deCONZ and would like to help, you can reach out [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/awesome-ha-blueprints-a-curated-list-of-blueprints-easily-create-controller-based-automations-remotes-switches-for-controlling-lights-media-players-and-more/256687).
