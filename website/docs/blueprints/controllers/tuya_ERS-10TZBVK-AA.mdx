## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided Tuya ERS-10TZBVK-AA Smart knob. Supports controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA. The blueprint will automagically detect the integration type and take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

This device operates in two modes, event mode and command mode. Three presses/clicks on the remotes button will switch between the two modes.

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events when in command mode, which are not exposed by the controller device itself. However, It needs to be enabled in the blueprint.
When in event mode, double presses are native.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with lights, media players, covers and maybe more in the future. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/tuya_ERS-10TZBVK-AA#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement id='zigbee2mqtt' />
<Requirement id='zha' />

## Inputs

<Inputs category='controllers' id='tuya_ERS-10TZBVK-AA' />

## Available Hooks

:::note Virtual double press actions
Some of the following mappings might include actions for virtual double press events, which are disabled by default.
If you are using a hook mapping which provides an action for a virtual double press event, please make sure to enable support for virtual double press on the corresponding buttons with the corresponding blueprint input.

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.

#### Default Mapping

- Rotate left -> Brightness down (continuous, until stop)
- Rotate right -> Brightness up (continuous, until stop)
- Remote short press -> Toggle
- Remote left with press [Only in Command Mode] -> Color down
- Remote right with press [Only in Command Mode] -> Color up

[Light Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/light)

### Media Player

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.

#### Default Mapping

- Rotate left -> Volume down (continuous, until stop)
- Rotate right -> Volume up (continuous, until stop)
- Remote short press -> Play/Pause
- Remote double press [`Virtual` in Command Mode] -> Next track
- Remote long press -> Previous track

## Additional Notes

### Device Modes

This device operates in two modes, event mode and command mode. Three presses/clicks on the remotes button will switch between the two modes.
When in event mode, double presses are native.
when in command mode, double presses are virtual and needs to be enabled.
When in command mode, two additional features are enabled which are left and right while pressing down on the button at same time.

### Virtual double press events

It's important to note that the controller doesn't natively support double press events when in command mode. Instead, this blueprint provides virtual double press events. You can read more about them in the [general Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#virtual-events).
When in event mode, double presses are native.
