## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided Philips 324131092621 Hue Dimmer switch. Supports controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, deCONZ. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller itself.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/philips_324131092621#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement id='zigbee2mqtt'/>
<Requirement id='zha'/>
<Requirement id='deconz'/>
<Requirement name='Input Text Integration' required>

This integration provides the entity which must be provided to the blueprint in the **Helper - Last Controller Event** input. Learn more about this helper by reading the dedicated section in the [Additional Notes](#helper---last-controller-event).

## Inputs

<Inputs category='controllers' id='philips_324131092621' />

## Available Hooks

:::note Virtual double press actions
Some of the following mappings might include actions for virtual double press events, which are disabled by default.
If you are using a hook mapping which provides an action for a virtual double press event, please make sure to enable support for virtual double press on the corresponding buttons with the corresponding blueprint input.

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.

#### Default Mapping

- On button short press -> Turn on
- On button long press -> Color up (continuous, until release)
- Off button short press -> Turn off
- Off button long press -> Color down (continuous, until release)
- Up button short press -> Brightness up
- Up button long press -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)
- Down button short press -> Brightness down
- Down button long press -> Brightness down (continuous, until release)

### Media Player

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.

#### Default Mapping

- On button short press -> Play/Pause
- On button long press -> Next track
- Off button short press -> Stop
- Off button long press -> Previous track
- Up button short press -> Volume up
- Up button long press -> Volume up (continuous, until release)
- Down button short press -> Volume down
- Down button long press -> Volume down (continuous, until release)

## Additional Notes

### Helper - Last Controller Event

The `helper_last_controller_event` (Helper - Last Controller Event) input serves as a permanent storage area for the automation. The stored info is used to implement the blueprint's core functionality. To learn more about the helper, how it's used and why it's required, you can read the dedicated section in the [Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#helper---last-controller-event-input).

### Virtual double press events

It's also important to note that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. Instead , this blueprint provides virtual double press events. You can read more about them in the [general Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#virtual-events).

## Changelog

- **2021-03-27**: first blueprint version :tada:
- **2021-04-19**: Fix double press events not being detected with deCONZ
- **2021-04-23**: Fix deCONZ events not being recognized
- **2021-05-26**:

  :warning: **Breaking Change**:

  `helper_last_controller_event` is now a mandatory input. It also simplifies the blueprint setup (reducing issues due to improper configuration missing the helper, which was required only in certain conditions as was stated in the docs), and provides support for advanced features which might be developed in the future.

  If you plan to update this blueprint, please make sure to provide a valid `input_text` entity for the `helper_last_controller_event` input. You should create a separate `input_text` for each Controller blueprint you're configuring, since using the same for multiple automation could lead to inconsistencies and undefined behaviour.

  **Other changes:**

  - :tada: Add Debouncing support. Debouncing avoids duplicate action runs which might occur with certain controllers and integrations. The feature is disabled by default, check the documentation to find out how to enable it
  - Prevent undesired endless loops, which might occur in rare cases when the corresponding stop event is not received, by running loop actions a finite number of times, customizable with four new blueprint inputs
  - Fix inputs wrongly marked as required
  - Fix for Zigbee2MQTT reporting null state changes

- **2021-08-02**: Improve inputs documentation and organization
- **2021-10-26**: Standardize blueprints structure and inputs naming across the whole collection. Improve blueprint documentation. No functionality change.
- **2021-11-19**: Fix controller events not being recognized when using ZHA.
- **2022-08-08**: Optimize characters usage for the `helper_last_controller_event` text input.
- **2025-02-13**:

  :warning: **Breaking Change**:

  Migrate to Zigbee2MQTT MQTT Device Triggers. ([@yarafie](https://github.com/yarafie))

  The `controller_entity` input has been deprecated, and `controller_device` is now mandatory.
  If you are a Zigbee2MQTT user and plan to update this blueprint, please make sure to remove the `controller_entity` input from your automation config and add the device ID of your controller to the `controller_device` input.
  To obtain the device ID from your controller, configure the automation from the UI and use the device selector dropdown on the `controller_device` input to select your controller.

- **2025-03-20**: Standardized input naming format for controller devices and virtual button actions. No functionality changes.
